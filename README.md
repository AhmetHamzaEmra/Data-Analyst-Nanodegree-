# Projects:

## Statistics: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results. Use the Statistics Placement Advisor to determine if reviewing any of the Statistics course will help you prepare for this project.

## Intro to Data Analysis: Investigate a Dataset

Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

## Data Wrangling: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data

Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Choose to learn SQL or MongoDB and apply your chosen schema to the project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore and Summarize Data

Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and relationships.

## Intro to Machine Learning: Identify Fraud from Enron Email

Play detective and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

## Data Visualization: Make Effective Data Visualization

Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. Use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

## A/B Testing: Design an A/B Test

Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.
